technology heterogeneity

- worked in practice
- especially for persistence it worked
- different databases can also be used with one service

resilience
- system fails even if one microservice fails
- authentication service should instance
- reality: service took over when database failed
- difference to SOA: not vendor-related
    - no broker, registry required
- ecommerce systems: orders should be placed at any time

individual scaling
    - used in actual projects

ease of deployment
 - not easy to deploy but quicker (all kind of tests/...)
 - infrastructure needed for deployment
 - CI/CD can also be used for monothilic architecture

organization alignment
 - two pizza team
 - monolith split up in different business teams
 - different processes / different countries

- replaceability
    - ok, but still costs

- distributed system
   - much more memory consumption
   -
